`fxp2aupreset` is a tool for converting VST presets to AU presets.

Installation
---

`fxp2aupreset` has modest requirements; it just needs the [construct][construct] library.

Running
---

`fxp2aupreset` requires information about the instrument whose presets are to
be converted. You can retrieve that information by finding your instrument using

`auval -a`

You'll see a bunch of lines that look like this:

     ...
     aufx mcmp appl  -  Apple: AUMultibandCompressor
     aufx mrev appl  -  Apple: AUMatrixReverb
     aufx nbeq appl  -  Apple: AUNBandEQ
     aufx nsnd appl  -  Apple: AUNetSend
     ...

The first three fields in this output (before the `-`) are the _type_,
_subtype_ and _manufacturer_ of the instrument. Each of these three fields are
four characters long. Additionally, you'll need to figure out which key is used
for the preset data in aupreset files generated by the instrument.

These four parameters can be specified manually:

     ./fxp2aupreset.py --type aufx --subtype mcmp --manufacturer aapl --state_key vstdata <path to directory full of .fxp files>

or (and this is the recommended method) you can give `fxp2aupreset` an example
`.aupreset` file generated by the instrument, and it'll figure out the rest:

     ./fxp2aupreset.py --example <path to example .aupreset file> <path to directory full of .fxp files>
